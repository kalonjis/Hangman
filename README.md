# Hangman

- Type of challenge: **consolidation**
- Repository: `Hangman`
- Challenge: **solo**
- Duration : **3 days**
- Deadline : **12/08/2020, 10:00 am**
- **Form: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15L9ltD_QdwpBJslozFXJYxKxjXsy0DjJW6zTThMIg0g/edit#gid=1167813783**

## The mission

You have to make a website version of the [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) word game. To do so
try to think the *structure*, the *backend* (functionality) and the *frontend*
(design) of your project before you start coding.

**At the very least your version of the *hangman* should:**

- propose an hidden word 
- allow the selection of letters
- verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
- count the number of failure (lives)
- check if it's a *game over*
- check if the word as been found

**Optionally it can**:

- keep in memory all guessed letters
- only let the player guess a letter once

**Bonus**:

- use canvas

NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing
things, what matters is the end result.

**Instructions**:

* create the repository
* think the project through
* write the backend (make it functional)
* write the frontend (make it pretty)
* implement both parts into a web page
